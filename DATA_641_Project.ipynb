            "[<p>It's no wonder the majority of millennials say they <span class=\"link\"><a data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=\"\" href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/retirement-social-security-millennials-plan-on-help-from-kids/\" target=\"_blank\">aren't factoring</a></span> Social Security benefits into their retirement planning, for years they've been hearing that the retirement and disability program is going bust. </p>, <p>Their belief is based on projections such as from the most recent <a href=\"https://blog.ssa.gov/social-security-2023-trustees-report/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Social Security Trustees Report</a> showing that Social Security's trust fund reserves will be depleted in 2033. That's one year sooner than the program's trustees had projected last year, and is partly due to shifts such as slowing economic growth.</p>, <p>Yet experts say that some Americans, especially younger workers, have misunderstandings about the impact if the trust fund indeed goes bust — a prediction, by the way, that's by no means a certainty. Even if the trust fund becomes depleted, the Social Security Administration will continue to take in payroll taxes from workers and their employers, allowing the program to pay the majority of benefits, experts note.</p>, <p>The problem, though, is that if the trust fund runs out of money, the program's 67 million beneficiaries will experience a benefits cut. And experts say those cuts could prove devastating to millions of older Americans, disabled people and children who receive benefits. </p>, <p>The impact of the trust fund's projected depletion was highlighted by Social Security Administration's Chief Actuary Steve Goss and Deputy Chief Actuary Karen Glenn on a recent webcast with other actuaries.  </p>, <p>\"At that time [if the trust fund is depleted], there will be an immediate drop in benefits of about 25%,\" Glenn said. </p>, <p>The system is designed to be progressive, meaning that the Social Security benefits paid to low-wage earners represent a bigger share of their earnings. For that reason, it could hit low-income Americans hardest.</p>, <p>Currently, retirees who were low earners while working — defined as earning about $30,000 a year while employed — get about 50% of their income replaced from their Social Security benefits, Glenn noted. But that would drop to about 40% of replacement earnings in 2033 if the trust fund runs out of money. </p>, <p>High earners, or people who paid Social Security taxes at the earnings cap, about $160,000 a year, would see their replacement rate drop from 25% now to 20% in 2033, she said. </p>, <p>\"The question is: Do you consider these benefits adequate?\" Glenn remarked.</p>, <p>The cut would prove more significant for low earners, an issue given that low-paid workers are less likely to set aside retirement funds or save up for old age than higher-income Americans. They're also likely to be more dependent on Social Security for that reason. </p>, <p>The result would likely lead to a spike in poverty rates for older Americans, predicted Nancy Altman, the president of Social Security Works, an advocacy group for the benefits program.</p>, <p>\"Not only would it increase poverty, it would deepen poverty for those already in poverty,\" she noted.</p>, <p>She added, \"You would really have to curtail your expenses. You might have to move; you might not be able to afford rent, and have to move in with someone who can take you in, like your adult children.\"</p>, <p>At the current trajectory, it appears very likely that the Social Security trust fund could run out of money in or around 2033. </p>, <p>But that doesn't mean it will. Lawmakers could make a number of changes that would shore up the trust fund and put it in financial health for 75 years, according to Goss and Glenn. </p>, <p>There are a number of proposals, from Democrats, Republicans and bipartisan committees, that tackle the trust fund's looming crisis. For instance, Republicans have proposed pushing up the <span class=\"link\"><a data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=\"\" href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/social-security-medicare-republican-proposal-to-boost-eligibility-age-to-70/\" target=\"_blank\">retirement age to 70</a></span>, effectively cutting between 2 to 3 years of benefits for today's workers — an idea that's not palatable to most Americans, with three-quarters telling an AP-NORC poll they <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/social-security-medicare-cuts-ap-poll-biden-9e7395e8efeab68063d741beac6ef24b\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">oppose it</a>.</p>, <p>Other proposals include raising the wage cap on taxes, set at about $160,000 this year. Currently, any income above that amount is exempt from the payroll tax. That means that middle- and lower-income workers shoulder a much bigger tax burden in funding Social Security than the 6% who earn above that amount. <span class=\"link\"><a data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=\"\" href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/social-security-benefits-tax-cap-2023/\" target=\"_blank\">Raising the income cap</a></span> could go a long way toward shoring up the trust fund, experts say.</p>, <p>Another option is to raise the payroll tax rate slightly, which could also cover some of the solvency issues.</p>, <p>Senator Bernie Sanders, an independent from Vermont, in February <a href=\"https://www.sanders.senate.gov/press-releases/news-amid-republican-threats-to-social-security-sanders-warren-schakowsky-hoyle-and-colleagues-introduce-legislation-toincrease-benefits-and-extend-solvency-through-2096/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">introduced a bill</a> to address Social Security's looming insolvency. His plan would add $2,400 in benefits each year for retirees, while applying the payroll tax to earnings over $250,000, among other changes. </p>, <p>\"The changes would have led to 75-year solvency,\" Glenn said, citing the Social Security Administration's <a href=\"https://www.sanders.senate.gov/wp-content/uploads/SandersLetter-2023-0213.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">analysis of Sanders' plan</a>.</p>, <p>The program has been shored up by lawmakers in earlier eras, which gives the Social Security Administration confidence that the program could be fixed before the 2033 depletion date, Goss said. </p>, <p>\"We are very confident that, as has happened in the past, that Congress and the executive branch will step up and make necessary changes so we won't confront that,\" Goss said. </p>, <p>But, he said, he's hoping the changes occur sooner rather than later. Making changes earlier \"provides more options,\" he noted. </p>, <p>Altman of Social Security Works noted that the crisis facing Social Security has been a talking point for far longer than millennials might realize. She's hopeful that the issues will be fixed, as they have in prior decades.</p>, <p>\"I started working on Social Security in the mid 1970s — I was young and starting my career and I was told I would never get Social Security,\" she noted. \"I was told I was the victim and it was these greedy geezers who wouldn't let benefits be cut.\"</p>, <p>She added, \"Now, I'm 73 years old and I receive Social Security.\"</p>]\n",
            "[<p><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/1928685/sandy-leon/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Sandy León</a> has worn many jersey numbers during a long career in Major League Baseball.</p>, <p>To understand the gravity of the No. 12 that adorns the catcher's uniform this season with the <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/TEX/texas-rangers/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Texas Rangers</a>, he has to revisit the worst day of his life.</p>, <p>That was Aug. 18, 2020. León, then playing for Cleveland, had just arrived by bus to the team hotel in Pittsburgh when he called his wife, Liliana, who was at home in Fort Myers, Florida, with their two small children.</p>, <p>He was growing concerned after several unanswered calls. Then he began getting alerts from his home security system.</p>, <p>\"That happens when somebody is making a lot of noise in the house, when the camera gets the sounds,\" León said.</p>, <p>He logged onto an app where he can monitor the cameras in their home. He discovered a horrifying scene with Liliana and their then-15-month-old daughter, Nahomy.</p>, <p>\"My wife was screaming, and she was praying,\" León recalled. \"She was saying words I didn't understand. Then I saw (Nahomy) on the ground. She was purple. She was dead.\"</p>, <p>Little Nahomy had wandered outside and slipped through an open gate to a backyard pool. She fell in the water trying to grab a rubber duck.</p>, <p>When a frantic Liliana discovered her, she was motionless and floating face down in the pool. She jumped in, grabbed the girl and rushed her to the kitchen, where she called 911 while trying to revive her.</p>, <p>Nahomy wasn't breathing. The natural color had drained from her tiny body.</p>, <p>\"She looked black, deeply black,\" Liliana said. \"I tried to open her eyes and it was blank. I don't see her eyes. All the things that I looked on her, she was dying, she was dying, she was dying.\"</p>, <p>Liliana hadn't been trained in CPR, but she tried it anyway. She pressed on Nahomy's chest again and again.</p>, <p>\"I did CPR like five times, but nothing happened,\" Liliana said. \"She didn't do anything.\"</p>, <p>Getting no response, she abandoned her resuscitation efforts.</p>, <p>Needing a miracle, she did the one thing she thought could help.</p>, <p>\"The only one who could do something for her was God,\" Liliana said. \"So, I just prayed. Holy spirit help me. Holy spirit help me. Because I knew that my daughter was dying.\"</p>, <p>She screamed that plea over and over while an ambulance raced to the house. Meanwhile, a terror-stricken Sandy desperately tried to comprehend what he was witnessing on that tiny screen.</p>, <p>Liliana clutched her dying daughter's tiny hand. It was then she noticed a small sign that gave her hope.</p>, <p>\"I started to see in her fingers, at the bottom of her fingers, that it was a little bit pink,\" Liliana said. \"Then all of her body color started to change, and she began to look like a normal, live person.\"</p>, <p>The mother wept as her daughter began showing signs of life.</p>, <p>\"Then she started to breathe,\" she said. \"But it was really, really difficult and really, like, forced.\"</p>, <p>Relief washed over Liliana.</p>, <p>\"In that moment I was like, 'Oh my God it happened,'\" she said. \"'She's alive again.'\"</p>, <p>Paramedics soon rushed in. As they worked on Nahomy, they peppered Liliana with questions about what happened.</p>, <p>The big one: How long was she in the pool?</p>, <p>Liliana didn't know. But she told them there was a surveillance camera they could check.</p>, <p>Nahomy was taken to a hospital, sedated and placed on a ventilator while the water was drained from her lungs.</p>, <p>Still unable to reach Liliana, Sandy talked to a neighbor, who provided scant details.</p>, <p>\"She told me (Liliana) brought her back and then the ambulance came,\" Sandy said.</p>, <p>Sitting in that faraway room in Pittsburgh, Sandy was at a loss.</p>, <p>\"I was having a hard time at the hotel,\" he said. \"I didn't know what to do.\"</p>, <p>Needing help, he called someone from the team. Officials chartered a private jet so he could get to his baby girl immediately.</p>, <p>Liliana was sitting in the hospital room with Nahomy when authorities who saw the video - which the Leóns showed to The Associated Press - came in to talk to her about what they saw.</p>, <p>\"They looked at me with that face that something really, really bad happened,\" she said. \"And they told me from the time she fell, until the time you picked her up was 12 minutes.\"</p>, <p>Twelve minutes.</p>, <p>\"When I heard them say that she was in the pool for that long, I broke down,\" Sandy said. \"I was like, 'She's not coming back.'\"</p>, <p>Doctors warned the family that even if Nahomy awoke, she was almost certain to have brain damage because of how long she was in the water.</p>, <p>They cautioned that she might not be able to walk, talk or do everyday things that people take for granted. The next 72 hours, they said, would be crucial in discovering what toll this had taken on Nahomy.</p>, <p>Sandy arrived in Fort Meyers at about 8 p.m. that night. He was not prepared for what he saw.</p>, <p>\"She was in the bed with all the tubes, and she still wasn't breathing by herself,\" he said. \"It was tough. I didn't know what to do. I went to my wife, and I just hugged her.\"</p>, <p>The couple spent that night in the small room with their little girl as she fought for her life.</p>, <p>A groggy Sandy woke up at 6:30 the next morning and couldn't believe his eyes.</p>, <p>\"I saw my daughter on her knees on the bed,\" he said. \"She's awake. I don't know what happened.\"</p>, <p>By 10 that morning, she was breathing by herself. She started talking immediately when tubes were removed from her throat.</p>, <p>\"She just said: 'Papi you're here,'\" Liliana recalled. \"He said: 'Yes, I'm here baby, with you.'\"</p>, <p>The Leóns were encouraged, but doctors still cautioned that Nahomy could have physical difficulties. But later that day, they removed the remainder of the tubes and put her on the floor.</p>, <p>\"And she started running,\" Sandy said. \"The doctors couldn't believe it.\"</p>, <p>Nahomy spent a few days in the hospital recovering and undergoing tests to make sure she was OK. Everything came back clean, and the family got to go home. The medical team told the Leóns they couldn't explain Nahomy's recovery. A few called it a miracle.</p>, <p>She's perfectly healthy now and has no lingering effects from the harrowing experience. She'll turn 4 later this month and revels in being a girly girl, loving anything that's pink or sparkly.</p>, <p>\"She really likes to think she is a princess,\" Liliana said. \"She really loves her dad. She's a daddy's girl. And she loves to sing, dance. She is a normal girl.\"</p>, <p>The Leóns shared their story with the AP before news this weekend that the 2-year-old daughter of Tampa Bay Buccaneers linebacker Shaquil Barrett <span class=\"link\"><a data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=\"\" href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/shaquil-barrett-daughter-drowns-pool-arrayah-tampa-bay-buccaneers/\" target=\"_blank\">drowned in a swimming pool at the family's home</a></span>.</p>, <p>Last year, several family members were reminiscing about what happened to Nahomy and her remarkable recovery in a group text. Someone suggested to Sandy - a journeyman catcher who has now worn seven different numbers with six teams - that he change to No. 12 to mark that interminable time she spent in the pool.</p>, <p>It wasn't available last year in Minnesota. But when he joined the Rangers this season, he finally got the number that means so much to his family.</p>, <p>And each time he buttons up that jersey and puts the No. 12 across his back, he says a little prayer to give thanks that the number didn't take his beloved Nahomy away.</p>, <p>\"I feel blessed and grateful every time I go onto the field knowing that she's normal and nothing happened,\" he said. \"She has no idea, but it's so special for me.\"</p>]\n",
            "[<p>Recent <span class=\"link\"><a data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=\"\" href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/tampa/news/first-republic-bank-second-largest-bank-failure-in-us-history-seized-sold-to-jpmorgan-chase/\" target=\"_blank\">turmoil in the banking industry</a></span> may have you worried about your money.</p>, <p>Shares of PacWest, a small regional bank based in Los Angeles, <span class=\"link\"><a data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=\"\" href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/bank-stocks-today-pacwest-western-alliance-first-republic-silicon-valley-bank/\" target=\"_blank\">plunged almost 40% Thursday</a></span> after the company confirmed it may put itself up for sale. Anxiety over potential bank runs has sent shares of smaller banks tumbling. A bank run is when large numbers of people withdraw their money from a bank all at once.</p>, <p>Since March, three regional banks have failed — Silicon Valley Bank, Signature Bank and First Republic Bank. If the recent bank collapses have you worried about the safety of your money, here's what you need to know:</p>, <p>Yes, if your money is in a U.S. bank insured by the <a href=\"https://www.fdic.gov/resources/deposit-insurance/brochures/deposits-at-a-glance/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.</a> and you have less than $250,000 there. If the bank fails, you'll get your money back.</p>, <p>Nearly all banks are FDIC insured. You can look for the FDIC logo at bank teller windows or on the entrance to your bank branch.</p>, <p>Credit unions are insured by the <a href=\"https://ncua.gov/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">National Credit Union Administration</a>.</p>, <p>If you have over $250,000 in individual accounts at one bank, which most people don't, the amount over $250,000 is considered uninsured and experts recommend that you move the remainder of your money to a different financial institution, said Caleb Silver, editor in chief of <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Investopedia</a>, a financial media website. </p>, <p>If you have multiple individual accounts at the same bank, for example a savings account and certificate of deposit, those are added together and the total is insured up to $250,000. (Read on for more about how joint accounts are protected.)</p>, <p>Federal officials have been taking steps to make sure other banks aren't impacted.</p>, <p>\"People who have their money in insured accounts have nothing to worry about,\" said Mark Hamrick, senior economic analyst at Bankrate.com. \"Simply make sure that deposits fall within the guaranteed limits, whether it's FDIC or the credit union equivalent.\"</p>, <p>Customers of banks that have been sold will have access to their money from the new owner, according to the FDIC. For example, JPMorgan Chase acquired First Republic Bank when it failed earlier this week and customers are able to access all of their money from JPMorgan. </p>, <p>If you are worried about your bank closing in the near future, there are some things you can watch out for, according to Silver:</p>, <p>— If it is publicly listed, watch the stock price. </p>, <p>— Keep an eye on the quarterly and annual reports from your bank. </p>, <p>— Start a Google alert for your bank in case there are news stories about it. </p>, <p>You want to make sure you pay close attention to the way your bank is behaving, Silver said. </p>, <p>\"If they're trying to raise money through a share offering or if they're trying to sell more stock, they might have trouble on their balance sheet,\" said Silver. </p>, <p>Public companies, including banks, do sell shares or issue new ones for various reasons, so context matters. First Republic did so this year when the hazards it faced were well known, and it kicked off an exodus of investors and depositors. </p>, <p>If you have more than $250,000 in your bank, there are a few things you can do:</p>, <p>— Open a joint account</p>, <p>You can protect up to $500,000 by opening a joint account with someone else, such as your spouse, said Greg McBride, chief financial analyst at <a href=\"https://www.bankrate.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Bankrate</a>. </p>, <p>\"A married couple can easily protect a million dollars at the same bank by each having an individual account and together having a joint account,\" McBride said. </p>, <p>— Move to another financial institution</p>, <p>Moving your money to other financial institutions and having up to $250,000 in each account will ensure that your money is insured by the FDIC, McBride said. </p>, <p>— Do not withdraw cash</p>, <p>Despite the recent uncertainty, experts don't recommend withdrawing cash from your account. Keeping your money in financial institutions rather than in your home is safer, especially when the amount is insured.</p>, <p>\"It's not a time to pull your money out of the bank,\" Silver said. </p>, <p>Even people with uninsured deposits usually get nearly all of their money back.</p>, <p>\"It takes time, but generally all depositors — both insured and uninsured — get their money back,\" said Todd Phillips, a consultant and former attorney at the FDIC. \"Uninsured depositors may have to wait some time, and may have to take haircut where they lose 10 to 15% of their savings, but it's never zero.\"</p>, <p>Historically, <a href=\"https://www.fdic.gov/resources/deposit-insurance/faq/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">the FDIC says it has returned insured deposits</a> within a few days of a bank closing. The FDIC will either provide that amount in a new account at another insured bank or issue a check.</p>, <p>If you have a <a href=\"https://edie.fdic.gov/fdic_info.html#06\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">joint account</a>, the FDIC covers each individual up to $250,000. You can have both joint and single accounts at the same bank and be insured for each. </p>, <p>So if a couple each has individual accounts and a joint account where they have equal withdrawal rights, they can each have up to $250,000 insured in their single accounts and up to $250,000 in their joint accounts. That means each of them will have up to $500,000 insured.</p>, <p>Customers should take a close look at the types of investments they have in their bank to know how much of their assets are insured by the FDIC. The FDIC offers an <a href=\"https://edie.fdic.gov/index.html\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Electronic Deposit Insurance Estimator</a>, a tool to know how much of your money is insured per financial institution. </p>, <p>FDIC deposit insurance covers:<br/>— Checking accounts <br/>— Negotiable Order of Withdrawal (NOW) accounts <br/>— Savings accounts <br/>— Money Market Deposit Accounts (MMDAs) <br/>— Certificates of Deposit (CDs) <br/>— Cashier's checks <br/>— Money orders <br/>— Other official items issued by an insured bank</p>, <p>FDIC deposit insurance doesn't cover:<br/>— Stock investments <br/>— Bond investments<br/>— Mutual funds<br/>— Life insurance policies?<br/>— Annuities<br/>— Municipal securities <br/>— Safe deposit boxes or their contents<br/>— U.S. Treasury bills, bonds, or notes<br/>— Crypto assets</p>, <p>Both <a href=\"https://mycreditunion.gov/about-credit-unions/credit-union-different-than-a-bank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">credit unions</a> and banks allow customers to open savings and checking accounts, among other financial products. </p>, <p>The key difference is that credit unions are not-for-profit institutions, which tends to translate into lower fees and lower balance requirements, while banks are for-profit. Sometimes it also means that it's easier for credit union customers to be approved for loans, McBride said. </p>, <p>Usually, customers are allowed to join credit unions based on where they live or work.</p>, <p>Credit unions serve a smaller number of customers, which also allows for a more personalized experience. The tradeoff is that banks tend to have larger staff, more physical branches and newer technology. </p>, <p>When it comes to the safety of customer's money, both banks and credit unions insure up to $250,000 per individual customer. While banks are insured by the FDIC, credit unions are insured by the <a href=\"https://mycreditunion.gov/share-insurance-estimator-home\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">NCUA</a>.</p>, <p>\"Whether at a bank or a credit union, your money is safe. There's no need to worry about the safety or access to your money,\" McBride said. </p>, <p>The Associated Press receives support from Charles Schwab Foundation for educational and explanatory reporting to improve financial literacy.

Referring to Carroll, Trump said, \"It's Marla,\" referring to his second wife, Marla Maples.</p>, <p>\"That's Marla, yeah. That's my wife,\" he said, before being corrected, and told it was Carroll.

Jennifer Love said she worked in a sexist work environment that often felt like a boys' club, according to the <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1JOpI7510iHYcHhyzFM8PQrnXxJ9bOAQr/view?usp=sharing\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">lawsuit</a> filed in Los Angeles Superior Court. Prosecutors said the investigation is focused on NFL corporate offices in New York and Los Angeles, where more than 1,000 employees work.</p>, <p>Attorneys general from both states said they've subpoenaed the NFL for documents about possible violations. Prosecutors are asking for copies of the league's policies on workplace discrimination as well as any correspondence about what happens to employees after they've filed a grievance to managers and human resources, California Attorney General Rob Bonta said. The NFL has 60 days to produce the documents, Bonta said.</p>, <p>\"This is the first set of requests and it may not be the last,\" he told CBS MoneyWatch. \"I wish it would take mere months, but it should be at least a year.\"</p>, <p>Bonta said one of the major thrusts of the investigation will be finding out if men and women in the same roles are being paid unequal wages. </p>, <p>New York Attorney General Letitia James said in a <a href=\"https://ag.ny.gov/press-release/2023/attorneys-general-james-and-bonta-launch-investigation-national-football-leagues\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">statement</a> that her office will \"ensure the NFL is held accountable.\"</p>, <p>The NFL defended its workplace practices, while saying in a statement that it plans to \"fully cooperate with the attorneys general.\"</p>, <p>\"These allegations are entirely inconsistent with the NFL's values and practices,\" the league said. \"The NFL offices are places where employees of all genders, races and backgrounds thrive.

NHTSA also has a <a href=\"https://www.nhtsa.gov/recalls\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">recall lookup tool</a> on its website.</p>, <p>\"These vehicles are 17 to 22 years old, and the risk to vehicle occupants is dire,\" NHTSA said in a <a href=\"https://www.nhtsa.gov/press-releases/bmw-takata-recall-do-not-drive-warning\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">statement</a> Thursday. \"These are some of the oldest Takata air bags under recall and have an extremely high probability of failure during a crash.\"</p>, <p>Since 2009, the exploding air bags made by Takata have killed at least 33 people worldwide, <span class=\"link\"><a data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=\"\" href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/third-exploding-takata-air-bag-death-confirmed-owners-urged-to-get-repairs/\" target=\"_blank\">including 24 in the United States</a></span>. About 400 air bag injuries have happened in the U.S.</p>, <p>The BMW recall comes a couple months after other automakers recalled their vehicles for the same Takata-produced air bags. Safety officials earlier this year told drivers of older Honda, Ford and Stellantis vehicles with Takata inflators <span class=\"link\"><a data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=\"\" href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/losangeles/news/us-tells-owners-to-park-old-hondas-until-air-bags-are-fixed/\" target=\"_blank\">not to drive them</a></span>. Honda said it has already replaced 99% of the dangerous inflators.</p>, <p>\"These inflators are two decades old now, and they pose a 50% chance of rupturing in even a minor crash,\" NHTSA Acting Administrator Ann Carlson <a href=\"https://www.nhtsa.gov/press-releases/consumer-alert-honda-upgrades-takata-alpha-recall-do-not-drive-warning-targeting\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">said</a> in February. \"Don't gamble with your life or the life of someone you love  — schedule your free repair today before it's too late.\"</p>, <p>Potential for the dangerous malfunction led to the largest series of auto recalls in U.S. history, with at least 67 million Takata inflators recalled. The U.S. government says that many have not been repaired. About 100 million inflators have been recalled worldwide. The exploding air bags pushed Takata Corp. of Japan <span class=\"link\"><a data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=\"\" href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/dodge-chrysler-do-not-drive-air-bag-death-takata/\" target=\"_blank\">into bankruptcy</a></span>.</p>]\n",
            "[<p>Some consumers who used Intuit's TurboTax could get up to $85 each as part of a 50-state settlement over the software maker's tactics that allegedly tricked consumers into paying for tax services that should have been free.</p>, <p>Under the settlement, Intuit must suspend its \"free, free, free\" ad campaign that promised free tax prep, but actually charged many consumers for the service, <a href=\"https://ag.ny.gov/press-release/2022/attorney-general-james-secures-141-million-millions-americans-deceived-turbotax\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">according</a> to a Thursday statement by New York Attorney General Letitia James. </p>, <p>The <span class=\"link\"><a data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=\"\" href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/intuit-turbotax-141-million-free-paid-products/\" target=\"_blank\">$141 million settlement</a></span>, which also includes residents in Washington, D.C., stems from a <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/inside-turbotax-20-year-fight-to-stop-americans-from-filing-their-taxes-for-free\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">2019 ProPublica report</a> that found Intuit relied on deceptive tactics to <span class=\"link\"><a data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=\"\" href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/turbotax-h-r-block-tax-software-overcharged-14-million-file-free-irs-inspector-report/\" target=\"_blank\">steer low-income tax filers</a></span> away from federally supported free services for which they qualified and into a product that charged a fee to file tax returns. </p>, <p>\"Today, every state in the nation is holding Intuit accountable for scamming millions of taxpayers, and we're putting millions of dollars back into the pockets of impacted Americans,\" James said in the Thursday statement.</p>, <p>In an emailed statement to CBS MoneyWatch, Intuit said, \"Intuit is pleased to have reached a resolution with the state attorneys general that will ensure the company can return our focus to providing vital services to American taxpayers today and in the future.\"</p>, <p>Here's what to know about the settlement.</p>, <p>About 4.4 million consumers across the U.S. are eligible for the payment, according to the statement. </p>, <p>People who qualify to receive a payment are TurboTax customers who used the product in the 2016, 2017 or 2018 tax years and were also eligible to use an Intuit IRS Free File Product. </p>, <p>Eligible customers also must have begun their tax returns using a TurboTax Free Edition Product but then have been informed that they were ineligible to use that product, and thus paid for a TurboTax product. Consumers must also have not used the IRS Free File Product in a previous tax year. </p>, <p>For the 2016 tax year, IRS Free File was <a href=\"https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/use-irs-free-file-to-file-taxes-for-free\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">available</a> for taxpayers who made $64,000 or less.</p>, <p>You don't need to do anything, according to the settlement website. </p>, <p>If you are eligible, you should receive an email from the settlement fund administrator that informs you of the approximate amount of your payment. </p>, <p>Payments will be mailed throughout May, the site says.</p>, <p>The payment is based on the number of years a consumer used the TurboTax product and whether they qualify. </p>, <p>Most consumers will receive between $29 and $30, the site says, although some individuals who filed for all three of the years covered by the settlement could get about $85, the New York attorney general said. </p>, <p>A multi-state investigation found that Intuit used \"several deceptive and unfair trade practices that limited consumers' participation in the IRS Free File Program,\" according to the New York AG's statement. </p>, <p>For instance, Intuit used similar names for its commercial \"freemium\" product and the IRS Free File service, and it also blocked its IRS Free File landing page from search engine results in the 2019 tax filing season, the investigation found. That effectively shut out people who were eligible for the free file program from using the service, the statement said.</p>, <p>Free File, a partnership between the IRS and commercial tax-preparation companies, should allow about 70% of U.S. taxpayers to file their tax returns for free, but less than 3% of taxpayers used Free File in the 2020 tax year, IRS figures show. </p>, <p>Intuit stopped participating in the IRS Free File program in July 2021.</p>, <p>The settlement website notes that while payments are being mailed in May, some people may not receive their checks until June. If you haven't received your check by mid-June, you can visit the <a href=\"https://agturbotaxsettlement.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">settlement site</a> and ask for a payment to be reissued. To do that, you'll need the claimant ID number from the email that you received. </p>, <p>\"Please check back in mid-June if you need to request a reissue, after all checks have been mailed,\" the site says.</p>]\n",

            " Before India's squad for the 2014 Under-19 cricket World Cup left Bangalore, Naushad Khan had come down to the city to meet his son. Sarfaraz Khan had found a spot as a batter in the 15-man squad alongside the likes of Shreyas Iyer, Sanju Samson, Deepak Hooda and Kuldeep Yadav. The side was coached by Bharat Arun, who would later become the architect of India's fast-bowling revolution. When Arun was told that Naushad was there, he called him up to his room. \"He told me not to worry and said everything would be fine,\" Naushad recalls. \"I told him, 'sir, please look after Sarfaraz, he is a little naughty'.\" Arun told him that Sarfaraz's humour was in fact an asset for the team. \"He isn't afraid to stare down Australian and Pakistani players and crack some jokes. That lightens the mood. This is his attitude. And the day he loses it, his performance will also suffer,\" Arun says. Nothing much has changed since. Sarfaraz still cracks jokes. He plays for Mumbai in the Ranji Trophy, India's leading domestic cricket tournament. His Mumbai team coach, Amol Muzumdar, describes him as \"the life of the team\". He's still unafraid on a cricket field and he's still scoring runs in abundance. In the last two Ranji Trophy seasons, Sarfaraz has scored 1,910 runs in just 12 games, averaging 136.42. He scored seven centuries in 18 innings, and also made 11 fifties. His achievements can't be overstated. The all-time record for most runs in a Ranji Trophy season is held by VVS Laxman, who made 1,415 runs in the 1999-2000. It is still the gold standard of domestic cricket batting in India. Laxman got to play nine games that season. Sarfaraz has played only six games each in the last two seasons. By the end of his ninth game in this run, he had scored 1,479 runs. That is the kind of impact he's had. Much of the credit goes to his hard work and dedication but also to Naushad, who coached both Sarfaraz and his younger brother Musheer, who at 17 is also making waves as a cricketer. Sarfaraz often gets teary eyed when he talks about his childhood. He wonders what would have happened to him if his father wasn't there to support him. Naushad would often put a price on his wicket during practice sessions. He would give the bowler 50 rupees (Â£5) every time Sarfaraz got out. He did it to ensure that all bowlers gave his son a tough time in net sessions. He would end up spending 300-400 rupees on some days. That was a lot of money for the middle-class family and this made Sarfaraz work hard and not give away his wicket easily. \"I'm not saying this because he's my father, but it's difficult to find such a man in this world. His  dedication is next level. He has problems in his knees, and eight years ago, the doctors told him to get operated. But he didn't because he thought that in case something goes wrong with the operation and he becomes wheelchair bound, how would he coach us?\". Sarfaraz was a prodigious cricketing talent in school in Mumbai alongside Prithvi Shaw and Armaan Jaffer. But Naushad briefly moved to his home state of Uttar Pradesh (UP) when he felt it was tough to get opportunities in Mumbai. But the season with the UP team didn't go too well either, and the family moved back to Mumbai. He  had to spend a mandatory \"cooling off\" period before he was eligible to play for the Mumbai team again. Another endorsement for his talent came in the Indian Premier League (IPL) T20 tournament when he became one of the three players to be retained by the Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB) in 2018. Former Indian captain Virat Kohli and South African star AB de Villiers were the other two. A new auction meant that the teams could only retain a handful of players and the remaining had to go into the auction pool. An RCB analyst later said that they had identified Sarfaraz as one of the few players who could score at a blistering pace. However, his form didn't hold up that season and he had to answer questions about his perceived lack of discipline. But he continued to score heavily in the longer format of the game for Mumbai and that has made him a leading candidate for a spot in the national team. A lot has been talked about Sarfaraz's weight but it doesn't bother him. \"When I have the bat in my hands, I get into that zone,\" he says. \"It doesn't matter who is watching then, selectors or crowd. If it's Allah's wish, I will get selected.\" He backs himself because of his hard work and the training his father gave him. He had to become a \"wandering nomad\" every year to practice. His father would drive him to UP to avoid the rainy season in Mumbai as most practice venues shut during this period. During their 1,400km (870 miles) journey, they would make a stop in every city that had a practice venue. And that's just one example of the hard work the father-son duo have put in to realise their dream of seeing Sarfaraz play for India. And given the buzz about him in the media, the day may not be too far. \n",

            " Parents outraged at school board members for dismissing book on Japanese American incarceration during WWII \n",
            " Parents are pushing back after a committee whose members sit on a Wisconsin school board did not move forward with approving a book about Japanese American incarceration during World War II for a sophomore English literature class. Muskego-Norway School Board members said including the book would require “balance” with perspective from the U.S. government, according to two parents in the district. They also said that minutes of a heated meeting with board members about the topic were not posted and that a video of another board meeting was reportedly edited. “She clarified and said that she felt that we needed the perspective of the American government and why Japanese internment happened. And so then again, we had raised voices at this point. I told her specifically, I said, ‘The other side is racism.’” — Ann Zielke, parent, on her conversation with the board vice president. As of Thursday, almost 200 parents, alumni, community members and staffers of the Waukesha County district had signed a petition demanding the committee reconsider Julie Otsuka’s book — “When the Emperor Was Divine” — which was not moved forward during the early stages of the approval process June 13. Board members also reportedly said a book cannot be chosen for the sake of adding diversity to the curriculum, said the parents, who spoke with board members and attended the school board meeting this month. Ann Zielke, a parent in the district who kept a detailed log of her interactions with board members and shared them for this article, said discussions around the book began months ago, after the district’s curriculum planning committee approved the novel in April. The book was subsequently sent to a group of three board members who approve educational materials before they’re purchased by the school board known as the educational services committee. Rather than move forward with the book, the committee — which is made up of school board Vice President Terri Boyer, Treasurer Tracy Blair and member Laurie Kontney — requested more time for review, the parents said. Zielke said she reached out to two board members for a rationale and eventually had a conversation the next month with Boyer, who sits on the committee. She said that in the exchange, Boyer said adding the book — alongside the class’ existing inclusion of “Farewell to Manzanar,” a separate memoir about Japanese American incarceration during WWII — to the curriculum created an “unbalanced” account of history.. Zielke said she was told “we can’t just provide one side or the other side” before the parent pressed Boyer about the issue, demanding the board member clarify her definition of “other.” “What she said to me was that we actually need an ‘American’ perspective,’” said Zielke, who said she pointed out that those who were incarcerated were, in fact, Americans, before the conversation grew increasingly heated. “She clarified and said that she felt that we needed the perspective of the American government and why Japanese internment happened. And so then again, we had raised voices at this point. I told her specifically, I said, ‘The other side is racism.’” Boyer said in an email that the book was not approved because of “concerns in our process, not the content of the book.” She wrote in a follow-up email that district policy states that the selection of instructional materials “shall not discriminate on the basis of any characteristics protected under State or Federal law” and that “concerns were raised about whether the policy was followed.” “To ensure the policy is followed, staff pulled the book from being recommended and will start the process over to ensure a fair and non-discriminatory process will be used to select a book for this class.” The historical novel, published in 2002, is loosely based on the lives of author Otsuka’s family. It follows the experiences of a Japanese American family from Berkeley, California, who leave their lives behind after the U.S. government forcibly imprisons them in a camp in Utah during World War II, when anyone of Japanese descent was deemed a national security threat after Japan’s attack on Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. Zielke said Boyer told her she received a tip that the book was chosen on the basis that it was written by a nonwhite author. When Zielke asked whether Asian students in the district deserve to see themselves in the curriculum, she said Boyer responded, “They can go to the library and check out any books they want.” School board President Christopher Buckmaster also brought up concerns about balance in a separate call with Zielke, she said. Asked to clarify what kind of balance Buckmaster sought, he recommended that the students read about the Rape of Nanjing, Zielke said. In the tragedy during the Second Sino-Japanese War, the Japanese military raped at least 20,000 women and girls and killed 150,000 male “war prisoners” and 50,000 male civilians in the Chinese city of Nanjing. Buckmaster did not respond to a request for comment. Brett Hyde, another board member, told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel that he sensed board members felt that the perspective presented in Otsuka’s novel too closely mirrored that of “Farewell to Manzanar” and suggested material related to the bombing of Pearl Harbor to provide “some history as to why the citizens of Japanese descent were viewed as a threat and what was the reasoning to have them put into the internment camps.” Another board member, Kevin Zimmerman, said in an email that he did not believe anyone on the board had concerns about balance. Records of the June meetings that featured discussions and arguments around the book are not available. Minutes of an educational services meeting, which took place June 13, have not been shared to the school board website, where the records are generally posted. When a copy was requested, Boyer replied in an email that the minutes have not been approved. A board meeting took place later the same day. When Zielke submitted an open records request for the video, Assistant Superintendent Jeff Petersen replied in an email, seen by NBC News, that the part of the video that was removed was “unrelated to the official business of the meeting.” Exchanges between board members and parents over the book took place before the meeting actually started. Tensions grew, and both parents said they were not given a fair opportunity for a true discussion with the board. Zielke said that when an alumnus expressed the desire to speak before the meeting officially began, an argument ensued. The discussion is not featured in the latest version of the video, from which seven minutes was cut, Zielke said. The district’s YouTube channel livestreams its board meetings, but Zielke, who repeatedly checked the page herself, said the recording was uploaded and then deleted June 14. The video of the meeting reappeared later that day, with the seven minutes removed, she said. “In response to your records request, the District’s technology personnel made efforts to determine whether the deleted portion of the recording was recoverable, and they have concluded that it is not,” he wrote. “As a result, there are no records responsive to your request.” Neither Petersen nor Boyer responded to requests for comment on the altered video. Zielke and another parent in the district, Allison Hapeman, said that at the June 13 committee meeting at which it decided against moving forward with the book, the members provided no rationale. “The dozen parents and alumni and students who showed up to that meeting just started yelling questions, because they were ready to gavel it out with zero explanation,” Zielke said. Buckmaster confirmed that the book was brought to the committee but was never moved forward to the full board. But he wrote that “at no point was this book banned or denied by the committee of the board or the full board.” “Rather, district staff recommended that it be sent through the staff committee process again,” he wrote. However, Zielke said, board members were clear in both private and public conversations about their disapproval of the book and did not indicate the novel would be sent through the process for another review. In a June 10 email from Boyer to Zielke, seen by NBC News, the board vice president wrote that “not approving a piece of curriculum should not erase the other 99% we do approve.” “The board is now saying that the district staff recommended the book come back, but that was not made clear to anyone at that ESC meeting,” Zielke said. “I walked away knowing the committee didn’t approve something having to do with ‘diversity.’ … It feels like a backpedaling reason to explain this.” Hapeman confirmed that when it was pressed by parents, the board members brought up similar arguments that had previously been presented to Zielke. She said the committee took particular issue with how the book was chosen to bring a diverse perspective into the curriculum. The committee's comments “pointed to their understanding or their belief that the fact that this book came from a diverse perspective meant that the committee that chose it was discriminating against white people.” — Allison Hapeman, parent “At one point, Terri Boyer, in the meeting, did say, ‘How would you feel if they were only allowed to choose books by white people?’” Hapeman said. Hapeman said that while many parents tried to air their concerns, they were cut off. “They get to have final say in who they will listen to. We were at the meeting that we are supposed to be able to speak,” Hapeman said. “But we were gaveled out while we were still speaking.” Hapeman added that the committee’s comments in the meeting “pointed to their understanding or their belief that the fact that this book came from a diverse perspective meant that the committee that chose it was discriminating against white people.” “They didn’t use that language, but everything pointed to that,” she said. Zielke said she has yet to hear from any parents who object to the book, and Hapeman added that the parents who’ve shown up at meetings have only supported including it in the curriculum. “I’m looking for my children to get an education that prepares them to live in the wider world. … And that’s what I believe that public education needs to provide to all our students,” Hapeman said. “We’ll be in the district for many years to come here, and I want my kids to be prepared for the life that comes next. And if these are the kinds of decisions that are continuing to be made, by narrowing the perspectives that they’re taught, then they won’t be prepared.” The Muskego-Norway School District’s decision has drawn ire from the Japanese American community, as well. David Inoue, the executive director of the Japanese American Citizens League, sent the school board a letter this month demanding that it reconsider the book’s use in the curriculum, particularly given the alleged arguments from board members. “In the case of the Japanese American incarceration, the United State government has formally apologized to the Japanese Americans who were incarcerated, admitting our actions as a nation were constitutionally and morally wrong,” he wrote. “The story of what happened to the Japanese American community is an American story, one that balances the challenges of injustice, but also the patriotic stories of service and resistance. If anything, these are stories that need to be told more in our schools.” “It is the absolute definition of racism to try and exclude something because it is a minority perspective.” — David Inoue, Japanese American citizens league Inoue said the school board’s concerns that the book choice could have been discriminatory was “ridiculous.” “It is the absolute definition of racism to try and exclude something because it is a minority perspective,” Inoue said. Otsuka also expressed disappointment in the school district, saying that in the two decades since the book was published, the material has never been the source of debate in schools. She said it’s critical for schools to lift up the perspectives of marginalized communities, like Japanese Americans, whose stories have predominantly been framed through a white lens. Over the years, she said, she has heard from numerous high school readers about how her book served as their first introduction to the subject of the forced incarceration of Japanese Americans during World War II. “For so long, history has been presented in a very one-sided way. It’s been written by mostly white men, and it historically has been about white men,” Otsuka said. “A revisitation of history. And just, you know, I think, from the perspective of people who might have been left out of the official account is long overdue.” Otsuka added that reading stories from a diversity of communities is a “radical act of empathy” that can only serve to benefit all students. “By reading, it collapses all distance between yourself and the other. You enter into their story,” she said. “It’s how we learn to be more compassionate human beings — by reading about people who are different from us.” \n",

            " Trump's 'fear factor' shows signs of waning as 2024 Republican hopefuls jockey \n",
            " If Donald Trump runs for president again, he’ll likely be the party's nominee. But a raft of GOP candidates looks ready to take him on, a sign he’s losing some of his dominance in Republican circles. Just this week, South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem launched a commercial aimed at introducing her to a national audience. Trump’s former U.N. ambassador, Nikki Haley, publicly floated a possible presidential bid Thursday in early state Iowa. And Trump’s former secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, began targeting evangelical voters in Iowa and South Carolina with a new ad on the Supreme Court and religious freedom. Meanwhile, Trump’s estranged 2020 running mate, former Vice President Mike Pence, is positioning himself for an expected run against his old boss, while Arkansas Sen. Tom Cotton has become a frequent visitor to Iowa and New Hampshire, another early-voting state. For months, consultants and grassroots conservatives like Iowa’s Bob Vander Plaats believed many of the Republicans were testing the waters in a less serious way, perhaps in the hopes of auditioning as Trump’s running mate. But now they think Trump will face a real primary. “The best way I can put it, is that if there’s a Trump candidacy — and so many of us respect what he did as president — many are afraid we’re going to end up in an endless debate on the past versus a debate on moving forward in the future,” Vander Plaats said of what he's hearing “on the ground” in the first-in-the-nation caucus state. \"Instead of it being about [President Joe] Biden’s record and $5 gallon of gas, the hasty withdrawal from Afghanistan, and disrespect on the world stage, it’s going to be debating Trump,” he added. “It’s going to be Jan. 6, it’s going to be the 2020 election. Let’s not have that. Let’s move forward, let’s have it about them. And we win. That’s what’s motivating a lot of people.” Vander Plaats and a dozen other national and early state Republican insiders who spoke to NBC News say the sense of weariness has been brought into sharper focus recently as the House committee investigating the Jan. 6 insurrection holds a series of revelatory public hearings. And though many Republicans aren’t watching it and aren't likely to believe its findings, they say, the hearings are still creating unwelcome pressure, leading some megadonors to say, albeit anonymously, that they’re backing away from Trump. But Jan. 6 is only one factor in the jockeying to take on the undisputed leader of the GOP, sources say. There's also the ambition of politicians that's typical for any end-of-midterm election cycle; a hope Trump won’t run again; a belief by some that he could be indicted as a result of Jan. 6 or his efforts to overturn the election results in Georgia; a sense Trump isn’t so supreme after Republican voters rejected his high-profile endorsed candidates in Georgia and other primary races; and Pence’s decision to defy Trump over Jan. 6 and appear ready to run against him. “The fear factor is gone for a lot of consultants and some politicians who otherwise were worried about crossing him,” said one top Republican consultant who, nonetheless, didn’t want to publicly cross Trump and spoke on condition of anonymity. Trump’s political operation listens to the whispers and monitors his potential opponents, and they say the former president is ready to take on all comers. “My belief is they’re all going to run, and a big reason they’re running is based on the fact that if Mike Pence can run, we can all run,” said Tony Fabrizio, one of Trump’s pollsters. “What’s the loyalty argument if your vice president is running against you for president?” For all the hits Trump has taken, Fabrizio said, his polling and public surveys show his favorability rating is still high among Republican voters: It hasn’t really fallen since he left office, and he’s still receiving about half of the 2024 GOP primary vote in crowded-field surveys, with Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis often trailing by double digits. But DeSantis has been consistently inching closer to Trump in those surveys while everyone else is mired in single digits. The Florida governor has also won a few key conservative straw polls and, surprisingly, moved marginally ahead of Trump in a recent Republican poll in New Hampshire, the first-in-the-nation primary state. Of the Republicans who might run in 2024, DeSantis and his team have denied the rumors the most. Additionally, the governor has not traveled with any great frequency to early-voting states, only heading to a South Carolina fundraiser held on his behalf in May and an April event in Nevada for U.S. Senate candidate Adam Laxalt, who was DeSantis’ roommate at the Naval Justice School. DeSantis adviser David Abrams said speculation about the governor's presidential positioning was \"comically wrong\" because he's focused solely on his day job and winning re-election. DeSantis has amassed a $124 million war chest for his re-election campaign while Trump, who began this year with $122 million cash on hand across his political action committees, has watched his one-time understudy with a measure of resentment and nervousness, said one Republican who recently spoke to the former president but did not want to publicly describe private conversations with him. “It would be a lie to say he’s not watching DeSantis and that DeSantis might be a big reason Trump announces early,” the Republican said. “Don’t get me wrong, if Ron thinks he can beat Trump, he’s wrong.” Dave Carney, a veteran presidential campaign consultant from New Hampshire, said he’s not surprised potential candidates are flocking to the Granite State or that there’s speculation about challenging Trump. He said one factor animating Trump and other Republicans is Biden’s low approval ratings and the belief that the president’s insistence that he’ll run again is a “façade.” “If Biden steps down, there’s a little less incentive for Trump to run,” he said. “But the Democrats will have a donnybrook on their side. It’s better for us either way.” In South Carolina, longtime Republican strategist Wesley Donehue said he believes every possible Republican candidate now is running a “just-in-case” presidential campaign in the hopes Trump doesn’t run. He said that, with the exception perhaps of DeSantis, none would beat Trump, especially in South Carolina. “Haley doesn’t have a shot against Donald Trump or against DeSantis here, and she was governor,” Donehue said. Haley, who lost standing with Republicans for criticizing Trump after the Jan. 6 riot, made sure to praise Trump last week in her speech at the Iowa Republican Party’s Lincoln Day Dinner. She suggested she wouldn’t run against Trump. Pompeo, Trump’s other appointee jockeying for a presidential bid, has been more direct in entertaining a challenge, telling CBS News’ Major Garrett last week that Trump’s decision would not have an impact on him. “I’m sure in some ways it would be uncomfortable,” Pompeo said, noting he was once considered Trump’s most loyal Cabinet member. “I suspect it would be a little uncomfortable for him, too. We worked so closely together.” An adviser to Noem wouldn’t say whether she would run against Trump but said that her newly launched TV ad is also targeting early state Republican voters on digital media. “We’re just getting started,” said the adviser, who did not have authorization to speak on the record. David Kochel, a top presidential consultant who hails from Iowa, said there’s only downside for potential candidates who don’t start “road-testing their message, meeting people in early states and building a financial network.” At the same time, he said, “there’s a growing feeling that more people are sick of the chaos and the drama” surrounding Trump. Scott Reed, another presidential campaign veteran and former top operative for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, said that “candidates are loosening up some … in the last six weeks there have been more 2024 strategic discussions and organizational meetings than in some time. There’s a feeling — a feeling, mind you, by some that Trump is fading, that there’s exhaustion. People are worn down.” But Trump’s pollster, Fabrizio, said the data show that Trump isn’t just in a strong position, but that more candidates only increase the likelihood that his hardcore base of supporters will have outsized influence. “When you’re at the top of the mountain, every little rockslide looks like an avalanche. But it’s not,” Fabrizio said. “The best thing that could happen to Donald Trump is all these people run. The victories will only look bigger if the field is bigger.” \n",

            " Freida Pinto brings Jane Austen-style film of her dreams to life in 'Mr. Malcolm’s List' \n",
            " For actor Freida Pinto, getting cast in a \"Pride and Prejudice\"-style romantic comedy was in many ways the fulfillment of a lifelong dream. A longtime fan of both classic literature and British romantic comedies, she jumped at the chance to star in a project that was an ideal combination of both. “When I first lived in London, I lived in Notting Hill, in part because of the movie,” the Indian star told NBC News of her all-time favorite rom-com, adding that she also always admired “Bridget Jones’ Diary” and various Jane Austen adaptations. “I can watch it over and over. I just love the dialogue, it melts my heart.” Pinto’s new film “Mr. Malcolm’s List” — in which she serves as both the star and the executive producer — is a very proper historical comedy of manners that will likely instantly connect with fans of shows like the Netflix smash hit “Bridgerton.” Based on the 2009 novel by Suzanne Allain, the film tells the story of the titular Mr. Malcolm, a very exacting bachelor in 1818 England with a long list of standards. Pinto — who first burst onto the scene with her star-making turn in the 2008 Oscar-winning film “Slumdog Millionaire” —  portrays main character Selina Dalton, a sweet young woman from the country who is thrown into his path by her childhood friend Julia (Zawe Ashton), a wealthy heiress who has reasons of her own to take Mr. Malcolm down a peg. “For me this movie is a mishmash of ‘Emma’ and ‘Sense and Sensibility’ and ‘Bridget Jones’ Diary’ and ‘Notting Hill’ –- which is my all-time favorite rom-com,” said Pinto, who added that she has watched all of the listed movies countless times. Pinto’s in-depth knowledge of Jane Austen — and particularly the deep and highly descriptive ways Austen wrote about women in the early 1800s — also provided crucial context as she brought Selina to life. “Of course I loved 'Pride and Prejudice,'” growing up, said Pinto. “And also ‘Sense and Sensibility,’ — I was really moved by the women in ‘Sense and Sensibility.’” While there has been a recent push to diversify the world of historical dramas with more people of color, Pinto notes that she personally had always been able to envision herself in the world of Regency England, simply because she had always immersed herself in stories about that era. “I studied English literature in college and I grew up reading Jane Austen,” Pinto told NBC Asian America during a recent video call from her home in Austin. “My imagination was already rife with the possibility of playing these characters.” But while Pinto had always seen herself in Regency-era dramas, until recently casting actors of color in historical films and television shows was relatively rare, even though people of African and Asian descent have lived in the United Kingdom for hundreds of years. Pinto’s co-star Ṣọpẹ́ Dìrísù, who is Black, noted the glaring lack of diversity in Regency dramas during a recent interview with IndieWire, noting that the reason he avoided the genre was “the absence of people who look like me.” In addition to getting the chance to star in a historical drama that closely mirrored so many of her favorite stories, Pinto’s instant connection to the characters of Selina and Julia was also a big part of why she knew she also wanted to be an executive producer of the feature length project. “As a producer, I was lending my name hoping it would attract financiers,” she said, adding that a big part of her producing experience involved hoping “someone would take a chance” on a project she wholeheartedly believed in. Some of the push and pull between the sisters in \"Sense and Sensibility,\" can be seen in \"Mr. Malcolm’s List\" through the sibling-like relationship between Pinto’s serious and practical Selina and Ashton’s impulsive Julia. “I can’t wait for audiences to embrace Zawe’s character,” said Pinto of Julia, the misunderstood heiress at the center of the film who attempts to turn Selina into the woman of Mr. Malcolm’s dreams. Pinto and Ashton first worked together on the Showtime drama “Guerrilla.” “She, to me, is the heart of the story.” Pinto adds that she is particularly proud that the on-screen chemistry of the cast — which includes actor Theo James and \"Emily in Paris\" cast member Ashley Park in addition to Dirisu and Ashton — was exactly what she always envisioned. Those tight bonds proved to be particularly important as the actors worked to film their scenes on location in Ireland in the midst of the pandemic and following heightened safety protocols. “There were so many moments of fun between the takes,” she said. “This is the dream cast that I always had in mind. It’s been such a wonderful journey.” It’s also been quite a long journey. “Mr. Malcolm’s List” began as a short film that immediately attracted attention from historical drama fans when it was first released in 2019 through Refinery29’s Shutterbox project, which aimed to both spotlight female filmmakers and unconventional stories. While 2022 audiences may naturally think of \"Bridgerton\" when they see a diverse cast in a very proper English comedy of manners, director Emma Holly Jones has spoken about how her then-unusual approach to casting her historical drama was actually inspired by the blockbuster popularity of Lin-Manuel Miranda’s Broadway smash Hamilton. “It completely challenged my preconception of what a period drama could be. Where it could go as a genre,” Jones recently told The Hollywood Reporter about seeing Hamilton on Broadway. “I felt like of everything I had seen before, it started to put a lot into question.” Many of those preconceptions, she said, revolved around what a Regency hero and heroine were expected to look like on screen. Hamilton, Jones added, gave her the freedom to allow “my imagination could go wherever it wanted to go” when she began casting both the short film and subsequent feature. But while “Mr. Malcolm’s List” preceded “Bridgerton” in many ways, Pinto says she and the rest of the cast fully embrace all comparisons to the now-beloved Netflix series. “It doesn’t matter who was first. If it hadn’t been for ‘Bridgerton,’ there wouldn’t be an audience for this film. We all end up helping each other,” said Pinto. “We are really happy for the phenomenon that is ‘Bridgerton.’” Pinto is also grateful for the chance to bring audiences a story that is fun and upbeat at a time when the news often isn’t. “We’ve living in a time where every thing is so hard,” she said. “It’s nice to work on something so hopeful.” \n",

            " Elite Russian regiment fights for support and the war for borsch \n",
            " Friday brought another deadly barrage of Russian missile strikes on Ukraine, with at least 21 people - including one child - reported killed in the southern Odesa region. Ukraine's emergency service said a nine-storey building and a holiday facility were hit in the village of Serhiyivka. Andriy Yermak, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky's chief of staff, accused Russia of being a \"terrorist country\". \"In response to defeats on the battlefields, they [Russians] are waging a war on civilians,\" he said. Read our full story here Fierce fighting also continued around the eastern city of Lysychansk - the last remaining city in the Luhansk region not under Russian control. Civilian deaths account for more than one out of every three of those recorded in Ukraine since 24 February, according to BBC News analysis of data from the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project (Acled) - a US-based non-profit group that records political violence. Experts say the total number of recorded deaths is likely to be a severe underestimate. Ukraine and Russia claim the number reaches into the tens of thousands - but their claims differ wildly and cannot be independently verified. To try to understand the human cost of the war, it is necessary to look at a number of sources, including the UN, national governments and independent monitors. Ukraine has renewed its call for more weapons supplies to resist Russia's invasion. President Volodomyr Zelensky told this week's meeting of Nato: \"We need to break the Russian artillery advantage. We need much more modern systems.\" If Ukraine did not receive the weapons it needed to defeat Russia, he said, Nato leaders would face a future war with Moscow themselves. Huge amounts of military equipment have been given to Ukraine by more than 30 countries, but heavy weaponry has been slow to arrive and in some areas Ukrainian troops have been heavily out-gunned. One of Russia's elite fighting forces, the 331st Guards Parachute regiment, is back in Ukraine after suffering heavy losses at the start of the war. State media tells a story of the unit's great heroism, but back in the regiment's hometown support for the fighters looks less certain. Glimpsed on the official Rossiya channel earlier in June, an armoured vehicle races up to a field hospital carrying several badly-injured men in the Donbas battleground. \"The [Ukrainian] tank was firing at us,\" one of the Russian paratroopers explains, as his wounds are dressed, \"...first near us, then straight at us.\" These flashes of the bloody reality of this war are rare, but acknowledgements of the price being paid by the army are becoming less so. Read more about this story here. There is mounting evidence that Russian forces in occupied areas of Ukraine are systematically stealing grain and other produce from local farmers, contributing to a grain shortage and a global food crisis. Ukraine claims that some of the stolen grain has been transported in a ship from a Russian-occupied part of the country, and has called for the ship to be seized. The BBC's Reality Check team has monitored the Russian-flagged ship, the Zhibek Zholy, on its route from the Ukrainian port of Berdyansk to the Turkish port of Karasu. It is not clear where its cargo came from or how it was obtained, but Russia has been accused of stealing grain from areas of Ukraine it controls. Moscow has moved to take over a major oil and gas project in which Shell has a 27.5% stake. Russian President Vladimir Putin this week signed a decree to take charge of the Sakhalin-2 project in Russia's Far East region. The move could force British multinational giant Shell and Japan's Mitsui and Mitsubishi to abandon their investments as the economic fallout of the Ukraine war spreads. This appears to be a deeply political move, the BBC's business correspondent Theo Leggett says. While the battle between Russian and Ukrainian forces continues on the ground, Ukraine has declared victory in a rather different kind of war after the UN's cultural agency added the cooking of borsch in Ukraine to its list of endangered intangible cultural heritage. Unesco said the war in Ukraine had \"threatened\" the practice of cooking borsch - a hearty soup usually made with beetroot and potatoes - in the country. \"Victory in the war for borsch is ours!\" Ukraine's Culture Minister Oleksandr Tkachenko said. Russia's foreign ministry ridiculed the move, stating that the dish had no need of safeguarding. \n",

            " Uvalde schools police chief Pete Arredondo resigns from City Council seat \n",
            " Embattled Texas Police Chief Pete Arredondo has resigned from his seat in the Uvalde City Council, roughly a month after being sworn in to the position. The Uvalde Leader-News was the first to report on Arredondo’s resignation plans early Saturday afternoon. Uvalde city leaders said they received his official letter of resignation late Saturday afternoon after learning the news from the local paper. \"After much consideration, it is in the best interest of the community to step down as a member of the City Council for District 3 to minimize further distractions,\" Arredondo said in his letter. \"The Mayor, the City Council, and the City Staff must continue to move forward to unite our community, once again.\" The news of his resignation comes after Arredondo became the central figure in a series of tactical mistakes, including the decision to avoid confronting an 18-year-old gunman, in responding to the mass shooting at Robb Elementary School that left 19 children and two teachers dead on May 24. NBC News has reached out to Arredondo’s attorney, but has not heard back. Arredondo was elected to represent District 3 in the Uvalde City Council on May 7 and officially sworn in a week after the school shooting. He is stepping down from the city council about a week after the Uvalde Consolidated Independent School District placed him on administrative leave on June 22. Hal Harrell, the superintendent of the Uvalde school system, had said in a statement he was waiting on investigations into the mass shootings to be completed when Arredondo was placed on leave. “Today, I am still without details of the investigations being conducted by various agencies,” he said. “Because of the lack of clarity that remains and the unknown timing of when I will receive the results of the investigations, I have made the decision to place Chief Arredondo on administrative leave effective on this date.” Lt. Mike Hernandez took over duties of chief, Harrell said. State authorities have described Arredondo as the incident commander during the school carnage. Arredondo has said he did not consider himself to be the officer in charge. Officials have said Arredondo incorrectly treated the gunman as a barricaded suspect instead of an active shooter. After more than an hour, federal agents entered the room and fatally shot the gunman. Federal and state agencies are investigating the police response. City, state and federal law enforcement officers were also present on the campus. A SWAT-like team of agents from U.S. Customs and Border Protection eventually entered the classroom and killed the gunman. Texas Department of Public Safety Col. Steve McCraw on June 21 described police actions as an “abject failure” during a senate committee hearing. “We do know this, there’s compelling evidence that the law enforcement response to the attack at Robb Elementary was an abject failure and antithetical to everything we’ve learned over the last two decades since the Columbine massacre,” he told lawmakers in Austin. During the hearing, McCraw said the classroom where the shooter was holed up was unlocked. It was widely reported after the shooting that police were kept from breaking into the classrooms and were looking for keys because the doors were locked. One hour, 14 minutes and 8 seconds passed from the time police entered the building until the gunman was killed, according to McCraw and a released timeline. “The only thing stopping a hallway of dedicated officers from Room 111 and 112 was the on-scene commander who decided to place the lives of officers before the lives of children,” he said. “The officers have weapons. The children had none. The officers had body armor. The children had none. The officers had training. The subject had none.” Law enforcement officers and at least one ballistic shield were in the school about 19 minutes after the gunman entered classrooms, according to McCraw and the timeline. Arredondo has generally avoided the media since the bloodshed on the Uvalde campus. But he told The Texas Tribune in June that officers never “hesitated, even for a moment, to put themselves at risk.” Arredondo, who took over as police chief for the school district in 2020, also told The Tribune he considered himself a front-line responder — not the person managing the broader response. “I didn’t issue any orders,” he told The Tribune. “I called for assistance and asked for an extraction tool to open the door.” According to The Tribune, once Arredondo determined he could not enter the classroom with the gunman inside, he dialed police dispatch from his cellphone and asked for a tactical unit, snipers and an extrication tool to open the door. “It’s not that someone said stand down,” Arredondo’s lawyer, George Hyde, told The Tribune. “It was, ‘Right now, we can’t get in until we get the tools. So we’re going to do what we can do to save lives.’ And what was that? It was to evacuate the students and the parents and the teachers out of the rooms.” Arredondo was elected to the Uvalde City Council on May 7, and he was sworn in during a private ceremony May 31, a week after the shooting. There was supposed to be a council meeting that day, but it was canceled because of the shooting. When the council reconvened for a special emergency meeting a week later, on June 7, he failed to show up. Arredondo also did not attend a meeting on June 21 at which the council unanimously declined to grant his request for a leave of absence from future council meetings. Uvalde Mayor Don McLaughlin said during the same council meeting Robb would be demolished because, \"You can never ask a child to go back or a teacher to go back in that school ever.\" \n",

            " 'We're here': Mexican groups slam U.S. abortion restrictions as they help more American women \n",
            " MONTERREY, Mexico — At first glance, it only looks like a roof terrace in a house in Monterrey in the Mexican state of Nuevo León, two hours from the border with the U.S. It's a small space, with a kitchen and bathroom, called La Abortería, or the abortion place, and it's become a haven for dozens of women and pregnant people — both from Mexico and the United States — who have decided to interrupt their pregnancy with the use of medication. “You have to talk about abortion as a responsible decision,” said Vanessa Jiménez Rubalcava, one of the space’s founders, in an interview with Noticias Telemundo. “Abortion is a loving and safe decision. It's also a simple medical procedure.” The abortion center has 17 people who advise and accompany the medically induced abortion processes of some 500 women every month, and it's part of the network Necesito Abortar Mexico, or I Need to Abort Mexico, a project created six years ago to support people who need guidance on abortion. “It’s about providing all the emotional, physical, economic tools so that women experience an abortion in a dignified manner,” said Ileana Sandoval, a woman who has undergone two procedures with the network's support and who is now part of the project. This counseling space is the first public place in Mexico that has been created for these purposes, and, paradoxically, it's in Nuevo León, a state where abortion is still a crime, despite the fact that Mexico's Supreme Court declared that it's unconstitutional to criminalize those who undergo the procedure. “We follow the protocols established by the World Health Organization and by the Mexican Ministry of Health,” said Sandra Cardona, a member of the network. “We use mifepristone and misoprostol as specified by both institutions in [pregnancy] cases that are already in week 12 or 14, and after that to make it safe. We accompany [the women in] these processes, both in person here and through calls and text messages or WhatsApp.” Cardona and Jiménez Rubalcava said that even before the U.S. Supreme Court reversal of Roe v. Wade, groups and abortion providers in Mexico began to detect an increase in the influx of people contacting them from the U.S. “Before, I only spoke to two or three people from the United States a year, but since March, they write to us at least seven or 10 a week,” Jiménez Rubalcava said. “It’s a different world, and we believe that demand can continue to grow.” Members of a network of volunteers, with people in Mexico and the United States, said they are ready to advise and answer questions from U.S. women seeking to have an abortion. According to these organizations' calculations, they have already served some 1,700 people from the U.S. so far this year. They have established cross-border alliances and drug banks in various regions in the U.S. to meet the high demand for information and abortion medication since the recent U.S. Supreme Court decision. Many clinics located near the Mexican border are expecting a dramatic increase in patients. As of September 2021, a Texas law prohibits abortions after about the sixth week of pregnancy; before, they were allowed until week 20. “We are here; they are not alone,” Cardona said. “No one should be left behind, and there should be no women without rights, which is what they are trying to do in the United States. There are no second-class women. It's not possible that in Mexico we already have these advances and there go backwards.” Mexico’s Supreme Court ruled earlier this year that an underage girl can get an abortion without parental consent if she has been raped. And in May, the southwestern state of Guerrero voted to allow abortions, becoming the ninth of the country’s 32 federal entities where women can legally end pregnancies. According to Profem, a medical organization that defines itself as helping with the legal interruption of pregnancy in Mexico, 25% of its clientele comes from the U.S. In Monterrey, people who travel from the U.S. buy abortion medications that cost $20 to $150, but at La Abortería they can be free. The Mexican activists say that almost all people seeking help use means such as social networks to contact them and, in many cases, are more than six weeks pregnant. In addition, they often express the fear they feel about what might happen to them legally when they return to their homes in the United States. \"We try to make each one experience abortion in the most dignified way possible,\" Jiménez Rubalcava said. \"I remember the case of a girl from Texas whose doctor wanted to send her to another state that was about 10 hours away, but she preferred to travel to Monterrey, which is only 2 1/2 hours. She also had family here.\" \"She came with her mother; we were talking and solving all those doubts, and everything went very well,\" Jiménez Rubalcava said. \"In fact, when she returned to Texas, she told me: ‘And now how do I tell my gynecologist, because he knew I was pregnant. I’m very scared.’ And I asked her to tell the truth, that the abortion was done at five weeks, which is legal in Texas, and that’s how it was. But they are new, difficult situations.\" Abortion rights activists in Latin America and the U.S. worry that with the recent U.S. Supreme Court decision, the country is one of the few where restrictions on abortions are increasing. “The case of the United States is an example that women’s rights can never be taken for granted, not even in the Global North. They are rights that must be constantly defended, and permanent actions must be taken to avoid any type of setbacks,” said Cristina Rosero, senior legal counsel at the U.S.-based Center for Reproductive Rights, which advocates for reproductive rights as a human right through a network of attorneys. During the last 25 years, the global trend has been toward the liberalization of abortion laws, and recently, large Latin American countries have taken steps in that direction, as are the cases of the three most populous nations: Argentina, Mexico and Colombia. Despite this, Latin America still is one of the most restrictive regions for abortion. Central American countries such as Honduras, El Salvador and Nicaragua totally criminalize abortion, which has resulted in women resorting to unsafe and dangerous procedures,  and a criminalization of those who have obstetric emergencies. Teodora del Carmen Vásquez is a Salvadoran activist who spent almost 11 years in prison after she lost her son in a miscarriage. \"Unfortunately, because I did not have immediate medical assistance, I lost my baby. Besides, I almost died, and then I went to jail,\" she said. \"That is the suffering that affects us women. We are the ones who pay the consequences of these laws so unfair.\" Although legal movements in defense of women's rights have achieved the release of 65 women who were detained in El Salvador, there are still four in prison, and the most recent conviction occurred a month and a half ago. \"We are quite concerned about what happens in the United States because it is a bad example. We do not like that what happens here is replicated in other countries,\" Vásquez said. Then there are countries where abortion is allowed when the life of the pregnant person is at risk, as is the case in Chile, and in other Latin American countries, other abortion allowances include rape, incest or a fetus that is not viable. Countries such as Costa Rica, Ecuador, Peru and Bolivia, among others, fall into the latter category. \"We have an interesting wave in several of the most representative countries that are moving towards an increasingly broad decriminalization of abortion,\" Rosero said. The green tide, as the movements in defense of abortion rights are known, have influenced legal changes. In September, the Mexican Supreme Court of Justice unanimously decided that criminalizing abortion was unconstitutional. Since then, five more Mexican states have moved to legalize abortions. Months later, the Colombian Constitutional Court ruled that abortion was no longer a crime. Both rulings followed the legalization of abortion by Argentina’s Congress in 2020, meaning three of the four most populous countries in Latin America have accepted abortion rights in recent years. “In order to achieve the progress in Colombia and Mexico, without a doubt, mobilization has been a key point,” Rosero said. “At least the criminalization of women has stopped a little, the persecution of the  issue; they have begun to talk beyond the stigma, but there is still a long way to go.” Activists like Laura Salomé Canteros see the processes of decriminalization or legalization of abortion as part of the universal demand for human rights, a movement that in countries like Argentina is closely linked to the fall of the dictatorship and the advent of democracy. “We work a lot from a popular perspective,” Canteros said. “We promote what we call social decriminalization to change society first. The truth is that the right to abortion is sovereignty over the body, over decisions and over life. That is why we achieve demonstrations with hundreds of thousands of people of all ages.” In Argentina, Law 27,610 legalized access to the voluntary interruption of pregnancy in 2020, establishing that all people with the capacity to gestate have the right to access an abortion until the 14th week. However, women whose cases fall under the grounds of  \"risk to the health or life of the woman or sexual violence\" can have an abortion without a time limit. \"The United States is a barbaric setback, honestly,\" Canteros said. \"But it's also an opportunity to organize and fight in an intersectional way, because that is what the judicial, legislative and executive channels are for. There is a wake-up call for the Democratic Party in the next elections.\" Despite recent changes, not everyone in Mexico supports abortion rights. A country that is almost 78% Catholic, according to the 2020 census, there are various organizations that condemn access to the procedure. \"When a woman decides to have an abortion, she's attempting against a life. We propose prevention, education and even contraceptive policies,\" said Juan Manuel Alvarado, a member of the group Familias Fuertes Unidas por México, which translates to Strong United Families for Mexico, which is against abortion. \"This pro-abortion tourism, it comes in a cascade. It comes massively, and there are no restrictions,\" Alvarado said. AActivists like Sandra Cardona are used to hearing criticism from the most conservative sectors of Mexican society. In fact, in many cases they were part of that trend before devoting themselves entirely to the defense of women’s rights. \"I was also one of those closed people because, when I was a teenager, I gathered signatures to criminalize women for having abortions,\" she said. \"First of all, I understand them, but what I tell them is that this decision belongs to each woman, each person with ability to gestate. We do not have to decide on the bodies of other women.\" An earlier version of this article was first published in Noticias Telemundo.

            " As tech companies pull back from Russia, China looks on with concern \n",
            " HONG KONG — Extensive efforts by Apple and other Western tech companies to curtail their business with Russia over its invasion of Ukraine have raised a question for product users in China: Could the same thing happen there? Much of Chinese consumers’ concern has been focused on Apple, which like Google, Microsoft and other tech giants moved quickly to curb its Russia business after President Vladimir Putin invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24. The company has stopped product sales and exports, limited services like Apple Pay and removed the Russian state news outlets RT News and Sputnik News from the Apple Store outside Russia. Download the NBC News app for breaking news and politics Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, as well as the global response, have been closely watched in Asia, where there are long-standing tensions between China and the self-ruling island of Taiwan, which Beijing claims as its territory. Chinese leader Xi Jinping has said “reunification” with Taiwan is inevitable and has not ruled out the use of force to achieve it, though the Taiwanese government says there are no signs of imminent attack. Chinese officials reject any comparison between Taiwan and Ukraine, saying only Ukraine is an independent country. But some online commenters in China, where social media is dominated by nationalist and pro-Russian sentiment, have criticized Apple’s actions in Russia and said China should prepare itself for similar tactics. “If one day China finally decides to liberate Taiwan, who can guarantee that our own iPhones won’t get deactivated?” one user asked on Zhihu, a Chinese social media platform similar to Quora. Experts say it would be difficult for Apple to walk away from China, which is a critical manufacturing center for the company as well as its third-largest market after the United States and Europe. “It is a very different story than what is happening in Russia,” said Kendra Schaefer, head of tech research at Trivium, a policy research team based in Beijing. Schaefer pointed out that Chinese regulations require Apple and other companies to store Chinese customers’ information on servers inside the country. “The question would be, does pulling out of China mean that Apple not only loses its customers, but all of its customer data completely?” she said. Apple did not respond to emailed requests for comment. Before the war in Ukraine, China was already pursuing a national strategy of “tech independence,” emphasizing indigenous innovation and the recruitment of overseas talent. Xi has stressed its importance in recent years as both the Trump and Biden administrations have tightened U.S. restrictions on Chinese tech giants like Huawei and ZTE that they deem threats to national security. “The U.S. sanctions on Huawei and ZTE during the Sino-U.S. trade war already abruptly awoke Chinese policymakers about the importance of technological self-sufficiency,” Angela Zhang, director of the Center for Chinese Law at the University of Hong Kong, said in an emailed response to questions. But Zhang said it could take decades for China to catch up with the United States and Taiwan in the manufacturing of semiconductors and other essential components of electronic devices. “It is also very costly, if not impossible, to achieve complete self-sufficiency of many hardcore technologies, which involve a very long and complicated supply chain,” she added. Russia’s growing isolation from companies like Apple has added to calls for China’s tech independence from the West, which is also referred to as the “great decoupling.” One commenter on Weibo, China’s equivalent of Twitter, noted his reliance on Apple’s cloud storage service. “Now I’m really worried that if anything happened, a company like Apple would deactivate my phone and my data,” he said. “The great decoupling is inevitable,” he added. \n",

            " Mosquitoes sniff out hosts infected with certain viruses, researchers find \n",
            " Smell can be a powerful motivator. The fragrance of freshly baked cookies may compel a person to come to the kitchen, while a musky perfume might entice a date. In the mosquito universe, an irresistible scent is one produced by two dangerous viruses after hijacking a human body, a new study found. The viruses that cause Zika and dengue fever alter how their hosts smell, making them more likely to be bitten by mosquitoes, according to researchers. The discovery was announced Wednesday in the journal Cell and is the result of experiments on both mice and people. The scientists also identified a potential way to block this scent and stop the spread of the disease, using a medication already known to people struggling with acne, isotretinoin, also known by the trade name Accutane. “In some countries, these mosquito-transmitted diseases are very prominent,” said co-author Penghua Wang, an assistant professor at UConn Health, the University of Connecticut’s school of medicine and medical center. “In the long run, if this medication really works, then people may have a way to prevent or at least reduce this burden.” The smell is linked to high levels of a compound called acetophenone, described by the study authors as a “potent attractant” for mosquitoes. It’s made by a bacteria that grows on skin, but normally skin secretes a protein that restrains it. However, this study suggests Zika and dengue suppress the production of this critical protein, allowing the bacteria to grow faster and for more acetophenone to emerge. This results in a scent that attracts mosquitoes and propels the cycle of infection forward. While people in tropical and subtropical areas — where these viruses thrive and are a leading public health concern — are likely to get bit by mosquitoes generally, this scent increases the odds that mosquitoes are biting infected individuals. Vectors like mosquitoes help viruses survive. When an infected mosquito bites a healthy person, it can transmit a virus. An infected person, meanwhile, can spread the virus to a healthy mosquito. Newly infected mosquitoes can go on to do more damage. Researchers previously discovered that malaria can alter the smell of its host, which in turn attracts mosquitoes. This suggested to the new study authors that it was worth investigating whether the same was true for Zika and dengue. Dengue is a viral infection caused by four closely related viruses. These viruses spread through the bites of two types of mosquitoes. While half of the world’s population is at risk of developing dengue, over 80% of cases are generally mild and asymptomatic, according to the World Health Organization. However, it can be more severe. While scientists report dengue cases may be undercounted because of Covid-19, on average it’s known to cause around 20,000 deaths each year. Zika belongs to the same family of viruses as dengue and is transmitted by the same kinds of mosquitoes. Most people with a Zika infection do not develop symptoms, and those who do experience ailments like fever, conjunctivitis and neurological complications. A Zika virus infection during pregnancy can also result in a birth defect called microcephaly. There is no specific vaccine or medicine for Zika virus. The dengue vaccine is only recommended for children between the ages of 9 and 16 who have already been infected — the aim is to prevent severe dengue in the future. The new study discovered a previously unknown step in the spread of Zika and dengue. These infections can change the way a person smells, and this scent makes them more attractive to mosquitoes, meaning they’re more likely to be bitten. For now, it’s unclear whether or not this process is the result of evolution or chance, Wang said. The study team infected mice with Zika and dengue to examine the link between scent and mosquitoes. They then set up three interconnected cages, dividing healthy mice, infected mice and mosquitoes. Each virus group was evaluated separately. However, the results were very similar: Around 70% of the mosquitoes chose to be in the trapping chamber with infected mice. The scientists also recruited dengue fever patients from a hospital in China and healthy volunteers. They collected the volunteers’ odors through armpit swabs and then extracted and transferred the compounds causing those smells to a piece of filter paper. Then a new seemingly unpleasant experiment began: A paper with the scent of either a healthy or infected person was attached to a volunteer’s hand, while an odorless paper was attached to their other hand. Both hands were exposed for 30 minutes to mosquitoes. Overwhelmingly, the hands covered in the scent of dengue patients were more attractive to mosquitoes than the other options. When the researchers evaluated the skin of the study participants, they found that the dengue patients showed a much higher emission of acetophenone than the other participants. Meanwhile, mice infected with Zika or dengue also produced 10 times more acetophenone than healthy mice. Scent remained the primary driver of mosquito bites even after scientists controlled for other attractants, like body heat and levels of carbon dioxide. After the scientists determined that mice infected with Zika or dengue produced less of the protein that kills the acetophenone-causing bacteria, they set out to find a solution. They fed the mice isotretinoin, a derivative of vitamin A and a known acne medication. This changed the bacteria composition on the skin of the mice and reduced levels of acetophenone. In turn, the mosquitoes were less interested in dining on the treated mice. Because mouse skin is different than human skin, the team now wants to see whether the same treatment would work for people. They also want to expand the study more generally and evaluate more human patients with dengue and Zika — this study only included 10 dengue patients. An effort is underway to recreate this study with a large sample of people in Malaysia. “Overall, the goal is to reduce the virus prevalence and the disease burden,” Wang said. “But this will take some time. This potential treatment will not kill mosquitoes, but it may reduce transmission.” In the far future, these results could also inspire the genetic editing of mosquitoes, Wang said. Other scientists are already experimenting with CRISPR to spread a mutation that blocks female reproduction. Scientists could also use CRISPR to interrupt this process linked to scent. “We could try to silence the mosquito’s olfactory neurons,” Wang said. “Those mosquitoes would still be able to reproduce, but they may be less responsive to human cues. They may be less interested in biting humans.” \n",

            " R. Kelly sentenced to 30 years in prison in sex trafficking case \n",
            " Disgraced R&B superstar R. Kelly was sentenced Wednesday to 30 years in prison, months after he was convicted on all nine counts in a high-profile sex trafficking case. U.S. District Judge Ann Donnelly handed down the sentence in Brooklyn, New York, after several of Kelly's victims angrily addressed him at the hearing. Donnelly minced no words as she threw the book at once-beloved performer. \"You were a person who had great advantages — worldwide fame and celebrity and untold money,\" she said. \"You took advantage of their hopes and dreams, holding teenagers in your house trapped. You were at the top of your organization, and you raped and beat them, separated them from their families and forced them to do unspeakable things.\" Victims who addressed the court said they had barely any will to live during their time under Kelly's control. \"You degraded me, humiliated me and broke my spirit,\" said a woman who went by Jane Doe No. 2. \"I wished I would die because of how you degraded me.\" The victim recalled an incident when she was forced to perform oral sex on Kelly \"after you played basketball, in a car full of your friends.\" \"Do you remember that?!\" she scolded Kelly, who was wearing olive-colored prison scrubs over a long-sleeve white shirt and wore a black mask. \"You couldn’t care less. I avoided your name and your songs and suffocated with fear. What you did left a permanent stain on my life.\" The victim stopped speaking momentarily when she saw Kelly speaking to one of his attorneys and sarcastically apologized: \"I’m sorry, I don’t want to interrupt your conversation.\" \"You are an abuser, shameless, disgusting,\" she added. \"I hope you go to jail for the rest of your life. I feel sorry for you.\" Kelly, 55, was convicted in September of racketeering and violating the Mann Act, the law that bans transporting people across state lines \"for any immoral purpose.\" The sentence was more than the 25 years federal prosecutors had sought in a letter to Donnelly this month.Jane Doe No. 1, who cried as she addressed the court, said she spent years believing Kelly would never face justice. “I know there are fans of R. Kelly who don’t believe us,\" said the woman, who was 17 when she first met Kelly at a concert in September 1994. \"I once lost hope in our justice system, but you restored my faith. It’s a constant battle, and I no longer live in silence. It is inhumane to endure sexual assault, sex trafficking. It is modern-day slavery in plain sight.\" Outside the courthouse Wednesday, the acting executive associate director for Homeland Security Investigations, Steve Francis, quoted R. Kelly's lyrics — \"sometimes silence can seem so loud\" — in praising the tenacity of victims and the judge's sentence. \"Thankfully these brave victims and true survivors will be heard forever, while Mr. R. Kelly will be left alone in a jail cell in silence for many, many years to come,\" Francis said. \"It's comforting to now know that that only loud noise he'll hear every day is his prison cell door slamming shut behind him.\" Kelly's attorneys argued in a separate memo that a sentence of more than 10 years would be \"greater than necessary.\" \"He has contributed to society with music and his generosity, and he has people who love and support him,\" defense attorney Jennifer Bonjean said in court Wednesday. \"He maintains his innocence, and he is not calculating and cunning. Mob justice is in vogue, but this court must distinguish between boorish behavior and criminal.\" During the trial, which centered on the allegations of six people, prosecutors said Kelly was a serial sexual predator who abused young women, as well as underage girls and boys, for more than two decades. Prosecutors alleged that he and his entourage led a criminal enterprise that recruited and groomed victims for sex, arranging for them to travel to concerts and events across the U.S. Kelly was also accused of confining victims in hotel rooms or his recording studio, managing when they could eat and use the bathroom and forcing them to follow various “rules,” including demanding that they call him “Daddy.” Attorneys for the singer, born Robert Sylvester Kelly, tried to portray his accusers as “groupies” who sought to exploit his fame and take advantage of the #MeToo movement. He pleaded not guilty to all charges and did not take the stand in his own defense. The convictions and Wednesday's sentence were also a watershed moment for women of color, who too often have not had their allegations taken seriously, U.S. Attorney Breon Peace said. \"These are the voices of mostly Black and brown women and children that were heard and believed and for whom justice was finally achieved,\" Peace said. The Grammy-winning Kelly, perhaps best known for the 1996 hit “I Believe I Can Fly,” was considered one of the kings of R&B in the 1990s and the 2000s, and he was widely credited with helping to redefine the genre. But the rise of #MeToo helped lead to greater scrutiny of his behavior behind the scenes. “Surviving R. Kelly,” a Lifetime documentary series released in 2019, which featured testimony from several accusers, intensified calls for him to face legal consequences. After his sentencing, Kelly is scheduled to stand trial in August in Chicago on federal child pornography and obstruction of justice charges. He was acquitted in 2008 of child pornography charges. \n",

            " The Supreme Court dealt a blow to the EPA's climate fight. Will states be able to fill the void? \n",
            " Dueling sentiments defined the day for climate activists, investors and lawyers as they reacted to the Supreme Court’s decision Thursday in West Virginia v. EPA, which eliminated some of the Environmental Protection Agency’s powers to regulate carbon pollution under the Clean Air Act. On one hand, many said they are gutted by the Supreme Court’s ruling. On the other, some feared the court would deal a more fatal blow to the Clean Air Act — and they think the decision merely shifts the venue for the climate fight. Climate lawyers said the ruling was narrower than the worst-case options they had feared and that it left legal openings for federal agencies to regulate carbon pollution using other parts of the law. “EPA still has tools to work with. EPA is still going to do the work of regulating greenhouse gas emissions from power plants,” said Jack Lienke, a policy adviser for the Institute for Policy Integrity at NYU law. “It’s frustrating ... but the game isn’t over.” The ruling will almost assuredly make U.S. climate goals more difficult to reach while shifting climate attention to the states, local governments and investors trying to capitalize on the falling costs of clean energy. While the federal government’s credibility could take a hit in international climate talks, momentum toward low-carbon power might no longer hinge on federal regulation, they argued. “Our governors are fired up,” said Casey Katims, the executive director of the U.S. Climate Alliance, a bipartisan coalition of state leaders who want to reduce emissions. Katims noted that in the time it took for the EPA regulation to reach the country’s highest court, dozens of states have passed landmark clean energy bills. The Supreme Court’s decision centered on the Obama administration’s Clean Power Plan and whether the EPA had the authority under the Clean Air Act to make utilities shift away from coal-fired power plants and move to generating power with wind, solar and other cleaner sources of energy. The court said the EPA could not require that shift, but it left other options intact for the EPA to regulate power plants under the Clean Air Act. “The agency will eventually propose a new rule,” Lienke said, suggesting that such a rule could require coal plants to adopt carbon sequestration technology, co-fire with natural gas or improve efficiency, which would all force emissions reductions. “We will have further fights about those options.” In reaching its decision, the court’s majority relied upon new legal reasoning that environmental lawyers worry has paved new avenues to restrict the administrative power of federal agencies. “The way this is written, and the invocation of the major questions doctrine, is a big shadow over environmental, public health and safety law,” Jason Rylander, a senior attorney at the Center for Biological Diversity, said, adding that “decisions like this have a chilling effect” on agencies like EPA as they try to enact rules and policy. (The Major Questions Doctrine deals with just how much authority regulatory agencies have.) Rylander fears the new doctrine could temper EPA ambitions when “it’s not a time to be timid about taking climate action.” With fewer options at the federal level and new uncertainty over how the Supreme Court will receive regulations, some states and local governments will look to pick up the slack on climate. “States’ authority to curb greenhouse gas emissions has not changed,” Katims said, adding that his organization would push for more states to adopt measures like renewable energy standards and zero-carbon electricity goals and to create carbon markets that cap power plant emissions. Some of that work is already going on at the city level, said Kate Wright, the executive director of Climate Mayors, a bipartisan group of nearly 500 mayors across 48 states. She pointed to places such as Los Angeles, which is closing city-owned coal and fossil fuel power plants, and Houston, which is powering municipal facilities with clean and renewable energy, as cities where local officials are taking the lead to address the climate crisis. But many of those efforts are limited by jurisdiction and funding, Wright said. The Supreme Court’s decision, which hamstrings climate action at the federal level, is a significant blow. “We can’t just print money,” she said. “We really are going to need the regulatory power of the federal government. We’re going to need the technical assistance, and we’re going to need the funding.” Former Vice President Al Gore similarly said the U.S. will need to explore other options to fight global warming. “We need to see state and local governments redouble their efforts to reduce emissions, we need to see the private sector step up and match their climate pledges with action, and most importantly, we must call on Congress to pass comprehensive climate legislation,” Gore said in a statement. Former presidential candidate Tom Steyer, an investor and a co-executive chair of Galvanize Climate Solutions, said in an interview that the ruling “puts even more onus” on private businesses and investors to fund projects that will deliver renewable energy at scale. “We’re really on the clock,” Steyer said, adding that wind and solar are the cheapest forms of electricity generation. “In the next 10 years, it’s not about investing in new technology. It’s about improving the technologies we have and deploying them.” The Supreme’s Court decision is likely to put the Biden administration’s 2030 climate targets even further out of reach, said Wright, of Climate Mayors. As part of the landmark Paris Agreement, a global pact that aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to avert the worst effects of climate change, the U.S. pledged to cut its emissions in half by 2030. The target could be in jeopardy without aggressive climate action from cities, states and the federal government, Wright said. The court’s ruling could also damage America’s credibility in global climate negotiations, especially with partners that have stronger climate regulations, like the European Union. “It makes it more difficult for the United States — the federal executive branch — to lead internationally on climate if we can’t deliver on our climate promise by 2030,” Steyer said. Vickie Patton, the general counsel for the Environmental Defense Fund, which was a party to the case, said that the Supreme Court’s decision was “damaging” but that the EPA still has other ways to control harmful pollution, including addressing methane emissions from the oil and gas industry and tailpipe emissions from passenger vehicles, trucks and buses. Such tools will become even more important, she said. Patton said that while the potential consequences of the Supreme Court’s decision are “alarming,” it should not be cause for despair. “If we all work together in the country — if it’s all hands on deck — we can get there,” she said. “But we have no time to waste. We’re really in a race against time to address the climate crisis.” \n",

              "'WASHINGTON — A federal judge indicated Wednesday that then-President Donald Trump\\'s remarks on Jan. 6 telling a crowd to \"fight like hell\" before the Capitol attack could have signaled to his supporters that he wanted them \"to do something more\" than just protest. In a court order for the case against Jan. 6 defendant Alexander Sheppard, U.S. District Court Judge John Bates ruled that Sheppard could not raise the \"public authority\" defense at trial after his lawyer argued Trump had authorized his client\\'s actions at the Capitol that day. Bates, who was appointed to the court by former President George W. Bush, rejected that argument, ruling that \"President Trump neither stated nor implied that entering the restricted area of the Capitol grounds and the Capitol building or impeding the certification of the electoral vote was lawful,\" and therefore a public authority defense was not viable. \"These words only encourage those at the rally to march to the Capitol — nothing more — and do not address legality at all. But, although his express words only mention walking down Pennsylvania Avenue to the Capitol, one might conclude that the context implies that he was urging protestors to do something more— perhaps to enter the Capitol building and stop the certification,\" Bates wrote. In a footnote, Bates noted that his ruling was not out of step with the Jan. 6 committee\\'s final report, which concluded that Trump acted \"corruptly\" because he knew stopping the certification was unlawful. His ruling was the first to cite the House panel\\'s report since it was made public last week. Bates further noted that phrases cited by the committee, such as “fight like hell,” could \"signal to protesters that entering the Capitol and stopping the certification would be unlawful.\" \"Thus, the conclusions reached here—that even if protesters believed they were following orders, they were not misled about the legality of their actions and thus fall outside the scope of any public authority defense — is consistent with the Select Committee’s findings,\" Bates wrote. He went on to say there was \"simply no indication\" that Trump informed the crowd that going into the Capitol would be legal. \"His speech simply suggests that it would be an act of \\'boldness\\' to \\'stop the steal,\\'\" Bates wrote. Several other defendants have tried to raise the public authority defense, including Danny Rodriquez, the MAGA-hatted Jan. 6 rioter who drove a stun gun into the neck of now-former Metropolitan Police Department officer Michael Fanone. The strategy of blaming Trump has not proven effective at trial. Dustin Thompson, who was convicted on all counts, had told a jury he was seeking Trump\\'s \"approval\" and that he thought he was \"following presidential orders.\" Thompson was sentenced to three years in federal prison for stealing a coat rack and a bottle of liquor while storming the Capitol. In a filing earlier this month in the Sheppard case, the Justice Department argued it was \"objectively unreasonable to conclude that President Trump or any other Executive Branch official could authorize citizens to engage in violent or assaultive conduct toward law enforcement officers and interfere with the Electoral College proceedings that were being conducted\" and that Trump\\'s speech did not advise Sheppard that his conduct was legal.'"

              "'Actress June Brown, who played the much-loved character Dot Cotton on EastEnders for more than three decades, has died at the age of 95. Her family said they were \"deeply saddened\" to announce that their \"beloved mother\" had died \"very peacefully\" at her home on Sunday. EastEnders actor Adam Woodyatt described her as an \"incredible woman\". Dot Cotton was one of the BBC soap\\'s longest-running characters and a favourite with viewers. Brown first appeared in the series in 1985, the year EastEnders was created. She stayed until 1993, returning to play the same character from 1997 until 2020. An EastEnders spokesperson said: \"There are not enough words to describe how much June was loved and adored by everyone at EastEnders, her loving warmth, wit and great humour will never be forgotten. \"June created one of the most iconic characters in Dot Cotton, not just in soap but in British television, and having appeared in 2884 episodes, June\\'s remarkable performances created some of EastEnders finest moments.\" After Brown\\'s death was announced, many fans began sharing their favourite TV moment of hers - when the actress met Lady Gaga on the BBC\\'s Graham Norton show. One of EastEnders\\' best-known stars, Brown was in her late 50s when she joined Albert Square. Actor Leslie Grantham, who played Dirty Den, suggested her for the role. Until then, Brown\\'s career had incorporated stage, film and television, with appearances in Coronation Street and Doctor Who. Some of her biggest storylines included Nasty Nick\\'s murder plot, when her son, played by John Altman, planned to poison her so he could steal her big bingo winnings to use on drugs. He changed his mind at the last minute. One of her most moving and controversial moments came when her close friend Ethel, who was terminally ill, asked Dot to help her take an overdose of morphine to end her life. Dot wrestled with her Christian beliefs but ultimately decided to leave out morphine pills for Ethel to take. Her relationship with husband Jim Branning, played by the late John Bardon, was much cherished by fans of the soap. Brown remained a favourite with viewers for years, but during a podcast interview in February 2020, she confirmed that she had left the series \"for good\". In the last episode she featured in, Dot Cotton - or Dot Branning - left a voicemail message for another character, Sonia Fowler, saying she had moved to Ireland. Following the news of Brown\\'s death, Woodyatt - who played Ian Beale in the soap for 35 years - said in a statement: \"I\\'m lost for words, something June never was. \"So many memories, so much fun. Just purely and simply an incredible woman who had the most incredible life and career, I was fortunate to have shared a small part of it. They never made you a Dame (we did try), but to me you will always be Dame Brown.\" Gillian Taylforth, who plays Kathy Beale in the BBC soap, said: \"I\\'m truly heartbroken by this news. June Brown OBE, MBE, was an amazing woman and a truly wonderful actress. I shared many scenes with her over the years and she was always someone I looked up to and learnt from. There will never be another June Brown and I\\'m sending all my love to her family.\" Culture Secretary Nadine Dorries said Brown was a \"true national treasure\". \"There was nobody quite like June Brown. She captured the zeitgeist of British culture like no other in her many years on our screens,\" she said. \"Today we\\'ve lost a true national treasure but my goodness what a life she has led. Rest in peace.\" EastEnders executive producer Chris Clenshaw said Brown was an \"iconic\" character both on and off screen. The BBC\\'s director-general Tim Davie said: \"June Brown was a brilliantly talented actor who was loved by millions.  Her performances as the incomparable Dot Cotton delivered some of the most memorable moments in soap history.\" \"Our thoughts are with her family and many friends.\" After she left the soap, Brown starred in a Christmas drama podcast in December 2020 as part of a series about family separation during the pandemic. She played the mother of a son with Down\\'s syndrome in the play, which explored the strains of the mother-son relationship during enforced isolation. Other tributes were paid by former EastEnders star and activist Michael Cashman, who played the UK\\'s first gay character in a soap opera, Colin Russell. He wrote: \"She took this country on an amazing journey and changed it for the better.\" Cashman has previously spoken about how Brown helped him get time off rehearsals so he could go to an anti-Section 28 protest in London in 1988. Actor and writer Stephen Fry also said Brown will be remembered \"as a tireless and fearless LGBT ally\". He tweeted: \"June Brown, amongst all her other wonderful human qualities and achievements, will be remembered as a tireless and fearless LGBT ally - especially during the darkest days of HIV/AIDS and Section 28... it was a privilege to know her.\" Comedian Mo Gilligan also posted on Twitter: \"If you grew up on an estate there was always a Dot Cotton. Absolute iconic character in EastEnders.\"'"

              "'Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said \"we will not rest until justice is done\", amid further evidence of continued atrocities in Ukraine. Distressing images of civilian bodies in the streets of Bucha, near Kyiv, have led to international outrage over Russia\\'s actions. Foreign Secretary Liz Truss has called for Russia to be suspended from the United Nations\\' Human Rights Council. She has also pushed for tougher international sanctions on Russia. In a news conference in the Polish capital Warsaw, Ms Truss said: \"What we have seen in the streets of Irpin and Bucha are scenes that we will never forget. We have seen butchery, evidence of rape and sexual violence, as well as the indiscriminate killing of civilians.\" She added: \"We are clear, that after these appalling crimes, Russia has no place on the Human Rights Council\". A senior Westminster source has told the BBC the government is considering further action against Russian soldiers as individuals. Officials are looking at further sanctions that could target captains, majors and colonels in the Russian military. It is understood this additional pressure could also include looking at ways to hold Russian soldiers legally accountable. Mr Johnson has said the UK \"will not stand by whilst this indiscriminate and unforgivable slaughter takes place\". He added: \"We are working to ensure those responsible are held to account. We will not rest until justice is done.\" Ukrainian authorities said the bodies of 410 civilians have been found in the areas around Kyiv so far. Russia, without evidence, has said the photos and videos were \"a staged performance\" by Ukraine. Ms Truss reiterated the prime minister\\'s comments, saying that the UK \"will not rest until these criminals are brought to justice\". She said \"it\\'s very clear war crimes have taken place\" and the UK is taking \"the maximum approach on sanctions, nothing is off the table\". Ms Truss added that Nato needs to use a meeting this week to \"step up support\" and sanctions. She said these measures should include more countries banning Russian ships from ports, sanctions on more banks and other sectors. In addition to this, she said countries should set out a \"clear timetable\" for eliminating Russia energy use. Ms Truss met with Ukraine\\'s Foreign Secretary Dmytro Kuleba in Poland ahead of key G7 and Nato talks. Also speaking at the news conference in Warsaw, Mr Kuleba said: \"What you have seen, the horrors that we have seen in Bucha, are just the tip of the iceberg of all the crimes that have been committed by the Russian army in the territory of Ukraine so far.\" The foreign secretary will also hold talks with her Polish counterpart, Zbigniew Rau, on Tuesday. She has pledged a Â£10m civil society fund for Ukraine, including support for organisations dealing with sexual violence, following reports of Russian forces sexually assaulting people in Ukraine, as a way of terrorising the population. Ms Truss has said Russia\\'s President Vladimir Putin \"is yet to show he is serious about diplomacy\". She said \"a tough approach from the UK and our allies is vital to strengthen Ukraine\\'s hand in negotiations\". She added the UK would do more \"to ramp up the pressure\" on Russia and \"keep pushing others to do more\". The BBC\\'s Reality Check team and BBC Monitoring have been investigating Russia\\'s claims about the killings carried out in Bucha. Ukraine has accused Russia of \"deliberate massacre\", but Russia has crticised \"a staged provocation\" by Ukraine. The Kremlin claims the evidence, seen by the BBC and several news outlets, is inaccurate on three grounds: On Sunday, Mr Johnson said Russia\\'s \"despicable attacks\" on innocent Ukrainian civilians in Bucha and Irpin were \"yet more evidence\" of war crimes. US President Joe Biden has repeatedly called Mr Putin a war criminal and has recently said he should face a trial over the killings in Bucha. Mr Biden said he was also seeking more sanctions against Russia over the atrocities. Mr Johnson spoke to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky over the weekend. Following their conversation on Saturday evening, Mr Zelensky said there would be a \"new package\" of \"very, very tangible support\".'"
